# patch-correlate
npm library to correlate commits in a patch to the lines they change

For example, suppose you have a patch file with 3 commits in it, some
of which modify the same area of code. This will tell you which lines
were affected by which commits.

This is made mostly for my GitHub browser extension to show commit info
in pull request file views.
